        Find the users who have recorded track points inside the Forbidden City of Beijing.
        As the Forbidden City is quite rectangular, this method returns the IDs of all users
        who have recorded an activity bounded by the box with the following coordinates:
        - Bottom left:
            longitude: 116.392626

            latitude: 39.922705

        This is an approximation, as $box uses planar geometry. However, since the bounding rectangle
        is small compared to the surface of the earth, we consider the distortion due to the curvature of the
        earth to be insignificant.

        The method relies on a spatial index on the 'location' field on track points, which
        is set as we import the data set. Interally, we use the
        [$geoWithin](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/geoWithin/) operator

        have been to the far edges of the Forbidden City might get left out.

        When using `_type="circle"`, we use the
        [$geoNear aggregation operator](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/geoNear/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-geoNear)
